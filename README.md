# Turtlesvs.Straws
2d game for the class
Art: So for the art I included everything I had originally as well as added a lot of cool new things to make the game look and feel just better all around
Sound: I added a clicking sound effect for each time a button was clicked, a shooting sound effect, a different one for the sniper and normal turtle, then a start and end wave sound effects. The start sound effect is a fog horn and the end is a microwave beeping, I thought it would be funny.
Gameplay: Stuck with that the same, starts off slow and then progressively ramps up as well as giving the player more gold in order to purchase towers
